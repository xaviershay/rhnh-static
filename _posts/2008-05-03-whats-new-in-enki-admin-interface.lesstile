I've just finished up a fairly major over haul of the Enki admin area, finally throwing away the ugly SimpleLog stylings. Features include:

 # New visual style, heavily inspired by the "new Habari Monolith look":http://binarybonsai.com/archives/2008/02/19/i-named-her-monolith/
 # New dashboard, with space to add your own data (feedburner subscribers? analytics data?)
 # Nicer forms (thanks "formtastic":http://github.com/justinfrench/formtastic/tree/master!)
 # AJAX goodness for UI snappiness
 # Undo for item deletion (no more alert boxes!)

Screens:

Of course there's still more I'd like to add (in particular to do with tags), but isn't that always the case? I think it's pretty swish - if you've already got an install just pull from master, if you think you might like an install, head over to the  "Enki website":http://www.enkiblog.com.
