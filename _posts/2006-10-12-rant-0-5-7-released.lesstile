Recently I have had the need to do some C# work. Not wanting to stray too far from ruby, I used "Rant":http://make.rubyforge.org to build my project. Initially, Rant wasn't quite up to the task, so I rolled up my sleeves and did something about it. The culmination of my efforts comprise the primary component of today's 0.5.7 release, so check it out for some white hot C# build file action.
