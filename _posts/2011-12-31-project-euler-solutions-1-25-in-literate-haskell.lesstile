A holiday project!

<blockquote>
<blockquote>Project Euler is a series of challenging mathematical/computer programming problems that will require more than just mathematical insights to solve. Although mathematics will help you arrive at elegant and efficient methods, the use of a computer and programming skills will be required to solve most problems. â€” Project Euler.</blockquote>

Follows is my attempt at the problems. I use Haskell and mathematics, two subjects in which I am a novice. In writing about my solutions and discoveries, I hope to present a gentle introduction to both.
