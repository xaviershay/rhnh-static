Some changes went into rails 2.0.2 that mean the @setup@ method in test subclasses won't get called. Here's how it went down:

 * "8392":http://dev.rubyonrails.org/changeset/8392 broke it
 * "8430":http://dev.rubyonrails.org/changeset/8430 tagged 2.0.2
 * "8442":http://dev.rubyonrails.org/changeset/8442 reverted 8392
 * "8445":http://dev.rubyonrails.org/changeset/8445 added a test so it doesn't break again

You can see some code illustrating the problem in 8445. This affects two plugins that we're using - "helper_test":http://nubyonrails.com/articles/test-your-helpers and "activemessaging":http://code.google.com/p/activemessaging/wiki/ActiveMessaging.

For the helper test, the work around is to rename your helper test setup methods to @setup_with_fixtures@.
--- ruby
def setup_with_fixtures
  super
end
---

For activemessaging, add the following line to the setup of your functionals that are failing ("from the mailing list":http://groups.google.com/group/activemessaging-discuss/browse_frm/thread/d0c7f025b2855463):

--- ruby
ActiveMessaging.reload_activemessaging

{% endraw %}
