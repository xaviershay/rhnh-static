This was a light year for open source contribution, 168 by Github's count (and
some uncounted on Bitbucket). I've continued on the RSpec core team, though the
project is mostly stable and I haven't been particularly active. I did find
time to experiment with some new things however:

* Windows development! A [rather major PR](https://bitbucket.org/Nicksaurus/foreman/pull-requests/17) to Foreman to switch out the core solver and fix some UI lockups (among others) was the first time I've written C# in a decade. It, and the relevant UI libraries, are quite nice. Unfortunately the maintainer hasn't had time for the project so it's basically stalled. A fork is probably due. I also made a trivial patch to the [Ori Livesplitter](https://bitbucket.org/Nicksaurus/foreman/pull-requests/17).
* Small forays into frontend development with a [KSSU timer](https://github.com/xaviershay/kssu-timer) and a [glorious troll site](https://github.com/xaviershay/runnersonly) both in React, and some [assistant](https://github.com/yupferris/assistant/pull/3) [contributions](https://github.com/yupferris/assistant/pull/4) with VueJS.
* Taking advantage of my new Pixel phone to try my hand at Android development, with [contributions to Twisty Timer](https://github.com/aricneto/TwistyTimer/pull/113) and a new [system keyboard for input of Rubix cube algorithms](https://github.com/yupferris/assistant/pull/4).
* Continued leveling up in Haskell with a [Factorio data parser](https://github.com/xaviershay/factorio-hs) (likely broken on recent versions) and a woefully incomplete [clone of Opus Magnum](https://github.com/xaviershay/mopus-gagnum). I'm feeling reasonably confident with it now, and it's currently my go-to language for new projects.

And as always, a [smattering](https://github.com/looker/looker-sdk-ruby/issues/55) [of](https://github.com/stripe-contrib/pagerbot/issues/46) [issues](https://github.com/seattlerb/minitest/pull/672) to help improve documentation. Leave things better than you found them!
