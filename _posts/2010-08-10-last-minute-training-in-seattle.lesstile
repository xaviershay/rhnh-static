If you or someone you know missed out on Saturday, I've scheduled a last minute database training for Seattle *tomorrow*. <a href='http://www.dbisyourfriend.com/events/20100811/registrations/new'>Register here</a>. Last chance before I head to Chicago for a "training on Friday":http://www.dbisyourfriend.com/events/20100813/registrations/new.
