I am finally back in the family home for an evening, and the family decides to holiday up to Melbourne, leaving me here on my ownsome. Not keen to shop, I venture forth into the larder...

h3. Fake Maharagwe

Serves 2 hungry people

h4. Ingredients

 * 2 tomatoes
 * 1 can evaporated milk
 * 1 can chickpeas
 * 1 red onion
 * 1 clove garlic
 * Parsley
 * 1 tablespoon oil
 * Tumeric, Chilli, whatever other curry spices you have in your rack

h4. Method

 # Chop onion and garlic, fry in pan with oil and seasonings
 # Add chickpeas, fry for a short time only
 # Add milk, tomatoes, parsley
 # Serve over rice

This dish looks exactly like Maharagwe. Almost tastes like it, but my substitutes really are poor. Coriander over parsley and coconut milk instead make for a much tastier and lighter meal (although I also got stuck with abborio rice, which is too gluggy). Also makes it vegan, which is a plus. I'm unsure of the red onion - Mum is sold on them and won't use brown onions for anything - but it just feels wrong frying onions of the wrong color. They're only adding bulk not taste to this recipe, so I guess it doesn't matter. Tomatoes are the most important ingredient, as without them it is a little bland.

I actually did remember that I needed to take a photo of this one, but I couldn't find a camera anywhere. The family must have taken it to Melbourne with them. Next meal gets pictures, honest.
